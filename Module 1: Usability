Module 1: Usability
===================

- Introduction: Background
  - HCI is an interdisciplinary Design Science
  - Payoff: Social-Computer Interaction
  - UI affects individual users lives and communities
  - Factors for UI design are incredibly dynamic
    - for different displays
    - for different user groups: novice to expert and elderly to children
    - market pressure

- Usability requirements
  - Basics:
    - thoughtful planning
    - sensitivity to user needs
    - devotion to requirement analysis
    - diligent testing
    - while keeping within budget and schedule
  - Definitions for "User-friendly" - subjective and vague
  - The U.S. Military Standard
    - Achieve required performance
    - Minimize skill and personnel requirements and training time
    - Achieve required reliability
    - Foster design standardization
  - Goals for requirements analysis
    - Ascertain the user's needs
      - Include all tasks
        - Common tasks are easy to identify
        - Occasional or exceptional
      - Functionality must match need
        - Inadequate functionality frustrate users
        - Excessive - complexity makes implementation, maintenance 
          and learning more difficult
      - Usage scenario analysis
    - Ensure reliability
      - Actions must function as specified
      - data displayed must reflect the actual
      - user's sense of mistrust
      - system available as often as possible
      - not introduce errors
      - ensure user's privacy and data security
    - Promote appropriate standardization, integration, consistency, and portability
      - standardization
        - use pre-existing industry standards
        - Slight differences: increase learning times and errors
        - Gross differences: substantial retraining and burden users
      - Integration
        - run across different software tools and packages
        - existing tools/systems
      - Consistency
        - compatibility across different product versions
        - compatibility with related paper and other non-computer based systems
        - use common action sequences, terms, units, colors, etc.
      - Portability
        - allow for the user to convert data across multiple software and 
          hardware environments
    - Complete projects on time and within budget
      - late: other projects may be affected
      - costly: competitors may capture the market

- Usability measurements
  - ISO 9241:
    - Effectiveness
    - Efficiency
    - Satisfaction
  - Five human factors central to community evaluation
    - Time to learn
    - Speed of performance
    - Rate of errors by users
    - Retention over time
    - Subjective satisfaction
  - Forced tradeoffs
    - If lengthy learning is permitted
      task-performance times may be reduced by use of macros or shortcuts
    - If the rate of errors is to be kept extremely low
      speed of performance may have to be sacrificed
    - Project managers and designers who are aware of the tradeoffs can 
      be more effective in making their choices explicit and public
  - User studies
    - Costly
    - But part of any serious large-scale UI development
    - Gmail, Vista, etc, all release Betas
  - Survey (One simple strategy)
    - User profile and multiple-choice questions
    - Online survey, e.g., through Facebook

- Motivations for different types of UIs
  - Life-critical systems 
    - Applications: 
      Air traffic control, nuclear reactors, power utilities, 
      police & fire dispatch systems 
    - Requirements: 
      Reliability and effectiveness, error free performance
    - Not as important:
      Cost, training time, user satisfaction
  - Industrial and commercial uses 
    - Applications:
      Banking, insurance, inventory management, ...
    - Requirements: 
      - Ease of learning
      - Speed and error rates
      - Subjective satisfaction is fairly important
      - Internationalization
      - Speed of performance
    - drive/tradeoff by total cost
  - Office, home, and entertainment
    - Applications
      Word processing, electronic mail, search engines, social 
      networking tools, websites for user-generated contents, etc.
    - Requirements:
      - Ease of learning, low error rates, and subjective satisfaction
      - Infrequently-used applications - intuitive, online help
      - Market competition -> low cost
      - Choosing levels of functionality
        - layered or level-structures with graceful evolution
  - Exploratory, creative, and collaborative systems
    - Applications (For Creativity):
      Web browsers, search engines, artist toolkits, architectural 
      design, software development, music composition, and scientific 
      modeling systems
    - Issues:
      - Users may be knowledgeable in the task domain
        but novices in the underlying computer concepts
      - Remove the "Computer from the Work"
  - Sociotechnical systems
    - Applications (For Many People):
      Voting, health support, identity verification, crime reporting
    - Requirements:
      - Trust, privacy, responsibility, and security are issues
      - Verifiable sources and status feedback 
      - Ease of learning
      - Administrators: detect unusual usage patterns 

- Universal Usability
  - Users are diverse
    - different abilities, background, motivations, personalities, 
      culture, work styles, etc.
    - ultimate goal:
      try to make interfaces as usable and enjoyable by everyone 
    - understanding the difference is vital for expanding market share
      (International Consumer Market)
  - Different considerations:

    1. Physical abilities and physical workplaces
       - anthropometry: human dimensions from research
         5 to 95 percentile design ranges, sizes: head, mouth, etc.
       - no average user
       - dynamic measures: reach distance, strength, speed, etc.
       - other issues:
         - Screen-brightness preferences vary substantially
         - Vision: depth, contrast, color blindness, motion sensitivity, 
           and visual fatigue
         - Touch: keyboard and touchscreen sensitivity 
         - Hearing: audio clues must be distinct
         - Hand control
       - workplace design issues:
         - Human Factors Engineering of Computer Workstations (HFES, 2007)

    2. Cognitive and perceptual abilities
       - human ability to interpret sensory input rapidly and to 
         initiate complex actions makes modern computer systems possible
       - Ergonomics Abstracts
       - background experience and knowledge in the task domain and 
         the interface domain play key roles in learning and performance

    3. Personality differences
       - Designers must be aware that populations are subdivided and that 
         these subdivisions have various responses to different stimuli
       - Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) 
         - extroversion vs introversion 
         - sensing vs intuition 
         - perceptive vs judging 
         - feeling vs thinking 

    4. Cultural and international diversity
       - Kinds of cultural and international diversity
       - Internationalization: promote effective designs
       - Product Re-naming

    5. Users with disabilities
       - Over half a billion in the world
       - Early planning is more cost efficient than adding on later
       - "Americans With Disabilities" Act
       - gifts of computing:
         - Screen magnification
         - text-to-speech (TTS) conversion
         - speech recognition
         - Hearing: Conversion of audio tones to visual feedbacks
       - temporarily disabled

    6. Considerations for Elderly
       - Reduced: Motor skills, Perception, etc.
       - Though technology experience is varied (often uninformed), 
         strong practice skills (hand-eye, problem solving, etc.)
       - designers in many fields: serve older adult citizens
       - interfaces to golden-age software
         e.g., BrooksTalk: the Speech Project

    7. Considerations for Children
       - Emphasize entertainment and education
       - Abilities change with age
         - Evolving dexterity
         - Emerging literacy
         - Low capacity for abstraction
       - Teenagers are a special group
         - Next generation
         - Beta tester for new interfaces, trends
         - Hand phones, text messages, simulations, fantasy games, virtual worlds
       - Requires Safety - access to children
