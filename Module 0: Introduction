Module 1: Introduction
======================

- HCI is an interdisciplinary subject
  - Involves technology, design, sociology, psychology, anthropology, etc.
  - Most of us are from engineering or IT and come with a strong background 
    in technology and little else

- What is HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)?
  - Human -> input -> Computer -> feedback -> Human -> ...
  - Concerned with Design, Evaluation, and Implementation
  - Human
    - Users, single, group working together, sequence
    - User tries to complete a task
  - Computer
    - Technology, not just Desktop computer
    - Systems: Large-scale computer, Process control, Embedded
  - Interaction
    - Communication, direct/indirect
    - Dialogue + feedback/batch
    - Task oriented

- Who Contributes to HCI?
  - Computer scientists
  - Psychologists
  - Software engineer
  - Linguists and philosophers
  - Artificial intelligence researchers
  - Ergonomists
  - Sociologists and anthropologists

- Why Study HCI?
  - Major part of work for real software 
  - At a company you work on real software
  - Bad UIs cost
  - User interfaces are hard to get right

- Why Hard to Design UIs?
  - No silver bullet
    (straightforward solution to have extreme effectiveness,
     for productivity, quality and control)
  - User Interface design is a creative process
  - Designers have difficulty thinking like users
  - It is easy to make things hard.
    It is hard to make things easy.

- The Inmates are Running the Asylum
  - Author: Alan Cooper
  - Part of the problem is that programmers and Engineers are in 
    charge of designing software, but engineers often are not 
    representative of the users

- User Population Distribution
  - Power User
    People know&use the advanced features
    (Such users are often engineers, and the ones who write software)
  - Computer Literate
  - Everyone else

- Features vs. Easy to Use
  - One problem: software developers tend to equate features with design
  - This is not necessarily the case
  - Sometimes, less is more . . .MP3 player again...

- Product Triangle
  - Capability (Engineering)
  - Viability (Business)
  - Desirability (Design)

- Rethinking Design
  - Users Goal
  - Corporate Goal
  - Programmers Goal

- Recommendations
  - Have design at the Heart
  - Separate UI from Programming
  - People-oriented design
  - software engineers: I am not the user
